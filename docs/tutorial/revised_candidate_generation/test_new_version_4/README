This example is use the filter relaxed candidates method
that impose constraints as molecular configuration to relaxed candidates.

Using this method,
you can get only optimized structures that maintaining the molecular configuration.

For using this method,
you have to set the parameter to GOFEE's object like below

ex)	search = GOFEE(...,
			       impose_mol_constraint=molecule)
	search.run()

where the molecule is Atoms object.
